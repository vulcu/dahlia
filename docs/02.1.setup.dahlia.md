# Installation & Setup: Dahlia, Python, & HVCC

1. [Install python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for your OS (requires Python >=3.7)
    1. On MacOS and Linux Python 3.x may already be installed, this can be checked in the terminal using `python3 --version`. If it's not installed, installation is easy but the specifics will depend on your package manager (i.e. `brew`, `apt`, `pacman`, etc.). On some systems, python packages like HVCC are also installed via the package manager, and not via `pip`.
    1. On Windows, see this guide on [installing and troubleshooting Python](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyWiki/wiki/1c.-Installing-the-Toolchain-on-Windows#python-optional) for use with the Daisy ecosystem. Do NOT install from the Microsoft Store. Ensure the installed version is at least 3.8.
1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/vulcu/dahlia.git`, and navigate to the cloned repository.
1. Once navigated to the repository, run the following to create a new Python virtual environment (commands here are specific to **git-bash** in Windows and may vary slightly for other OS, i.e. `python3` instead of `py`):

```bash
$ py -m ensurepip -U
$ py -m pip install virtualenv

# if there's an existing .venv directory be sure to delete it first!
$ py -m venv ./.venv
```

5. Once the python virtual environment is installed to `dahlia/.venv`, activate it and install the Python package for this fork of the [Heavy Compiler Collection (hvcc)](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc), along with some additional required packages:

```bash
$ source ./.venv/Scripts/activate   # for MacOS/Linux this is `./.venv/bin/activate`
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ deactivate
```

6. Run the following to initialize all Git submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

7. If there's no errors from the above, then the basic **Dahlia** dependencies and configuration are ready to go. As a test, return to the `dahlia` root directory and compile Dahlia for the Heavy Audio Programming Language:

```bash
# generate HVCC output only with no generator target
$ source ./dahlia.sh
```
